/**
 * <p>Class responsible to manage all the services. This will is responsible to start and stop services,
 * following the expected lifecycle.</p>
 *
 * <p>This engine is meant to be as simples and as straightforward as possible, following the same API
 * that is already used to start Android Services.</p>
 *
 * <p>To start a service you should invoke the {@link #startService(Intent)} and pass the Intent, with
 * the details you're already used to when invoking Android Services.</p>
 *
 * <b>Example:</b>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Intent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), SomeSnapService.class);
 * intent.setAction("com.myaction");
 * intent.putExtra("EXTRA_KEY", "value for this key")
 * SnapServicesContext.startSnapService(intent)
 * }
 * </pre>
 * The above example shows how the service should be started. There will only be one instance
 * of each service running at the same time. If the service isn't running, it will be started and the
 * Intent delivered to it. If it's already running, only the intent will be delivered.
 *
 * <p>The SnapService follows a well-defined lifecycle:</p>
 * <ul>
 *      <li>{@link SnapService#onHandleIntent(Intent)}</li>
 *      <li>{@link SnapService#onDestroy()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>There are other calls to the available methods inside the SnapService, but those shouldn't be called directly.
 * This flow will be followed. If some exception happens when invoking either of the above methods,
 * the SnapService will continue to process the messages in the queue (if any) and finishing once all are done.</p>
